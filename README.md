# Matlab-LTSpice-Co-simulation-guide
The script test.m runs LTSpice from Matlab. It generates data for transient simulation and displays the spice simulated results.
Follow the simple steps to perform MATLAB LTSpice cosimulation.
1. Create a blank .txt file in notepad and save it with any name.
2. Create a spice schematic (.asc) file for the simulation.
3. Within that schematic, for a voltage/current source select 'PWL File'. Browse to the same txt file created. 
This source will receive data generated by Matlab script. 
4. The script test.m generates a particular signal and it invokes LTSpice from the drive where its is stored.
for me it was `C:\Program Files\LTC\LTspiceXVII\XVIIx64.exe'. Try to locate your one. You must need to have
the 'LTspice2Matlab.m'file in the same working directory.
5. Let the script to plot and your data.

you can use the following script available in test.m
CV1=1; %which variable to read voltage/current
CV2=2; %which variable to read voltage/current
x1=readfile.variable_mat(CV1,:); % reads nodal voltage
x2=readfile.variable_mat(CV2,:); % reads nodal voltage
subplot(2,1,1);
plot(y,x1,'k');
hold on
subplot(2,1,2);
plot(y,x2);
y=readfile.time_vect; % reads time vector extracted from .raw file.


** Example schematic file for simulation in LTSpice RCtest.asc**
**.txt file where MATLAB will write data is named as 'myfile.txt'**
